## üëâ Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** from `main` for your changes.
3. **Make your changes** and write clear, descriptive commit messages.
4. **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the original repository's `main` branch.
6. In your PR, **clearly explain** what you did and why.
7. Remember to **link the PR** to the issue it resolves.

## üíª Development Setup

To contribute to Prompt Alchemy, you'll need the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Go:** Version 1.23 or higher
- **Git:** For version control
- **Make:** For running build and test commands

Once you have the prerequisites, follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone [<https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/prompt-alchemy.git>](<https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/prompt-alchemy.git>)
    
    ```
    
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd prompt-alchemy
    
    ```
    
3. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
    
    ```bash
    make build
    
    ```
    

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

We take testing seriously to ensure the quality and stability of the project. Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your changes pass all the necessary checks.

The primary command to run the complete test suite (including both unit and integration tests) is:

```bash
make test
```

This project has a comprehensive set of advanced tests for different scenarios (e.g., `make test-unit`, `make test-e2e`). While you probably only need to run `make test`, feel free to explore the `Makefile` if your changes require more specific testing.

## ‚ú® Code Style

To maintain a consistent and clean codebase, we use a linter to enforce style conventions. This project uses `golangci-lint` for automated code quality checks.

Before submitting your pull request, please run the linter to ensure your changes adhere to our standards. You can run it with the following command:

```bash
make lint
```

## üìñ Documentation Standards

We believe clear and consistent documentation is just as important as clean code. Please adhere to the following standards when writing any documentation, including code comments.

- **Language:** All documentation must be written in clear, concise English.
- **Formatting:** We use Markdown (`.md`) for all documentation files. Please make use of formatting elements like headers, lists, and code blocks to improve readability.
- **Code Comments:** When adding comments to the code, explain the *why*, not just the *what*. Good comments describe the purpose and intent behind a piece of code, especially if it's complex.

## Let's Build Together

We are excited to see your contributions and look forward to building something great with you. Thank you for being a part of our community!
