# Hex Grid Fix Report - 100-Pass Investigation Complete

## Problem Summary
The hex grid nodes and connection lines were not appearing in the DOM despite the JavaScript loading successfully.

## Root Cause
The `init()` method in the UnifiedHexFlow class was never being called from the constructor. This method contains the critical logic to:
1. Check for existing server-rendered nodes
2. Call `createNodeNetwork()` to generate hex nodes
3. Call `createConnections()` to draw lines between nodes

## The Fix
Added a single line at the end of the constructor to call `init()`:

```javascript
// In hex-flow-unified.js, line 106:
this.init();
```

## Investigation Process
Through the 100-pass investigation, discovered:
1. ✅ Script loads successfully (returns 200)
2. ✅ DOM elements exist (container, SVG, groups)
3. ✅ Constructor runs and initializes properties
4. ✅ generateRadialLayout() creates node definitions with positions
5. ❌ createNodeNetwork() was never called
6. ❌ No nodes were appended to the DOM

## Verification Steps
1. Rebuild Docker containers: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
2. Restart containers: `docker-compose --profile hybrid up -d`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8090
4. Open browser console and run: `/tmp/verify-hex-grid-fix.js`

## Expected Result
You should now see:
- Multiple hexagonal nodes arranged in a radial pattern
- Connection lines between the nodes
- Node labels and icons/images
- Hover effects and interactivity

## Additional Improvements Made
- Added comprehensive error handling in createHexNode()
- Added detailed debugging logs throughout the initialization flow
- Moved all node creation code inside try-catch blocks
- Added verification logging for appendChild operations
