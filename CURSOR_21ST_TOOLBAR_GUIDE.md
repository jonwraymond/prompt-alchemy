## üîß Cursor-Specific Activation Steps

```bash
# From your project directory
cursor .
```

2. Press `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux)

2. **Click on the gray bar** - it should expand or show more options
3. **Check the browser console** - you should see connection messages
4. **Look for the status indicator** - top-right corner should show connection status

- **Click on any element** on the page
- **Right-click** on elements to see context menus

## üîç Cursor-Specific Troubleshooting

### If the Toolbar Still Shows as Gray Bar:

1. **Restart Cursor completely**
   ```bash
   # Close Cursor, then reopen
   cursor .
   ```

2. **Check if the extension is running in Cursor**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Show Running Extensions"

4. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)

### If You See Connection Errors:

The errors you're seeing are **normal and expected**:
```
GET http://localhost:5747/ping/stagewise net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
GET http://localhost:5748/ping/stagewise net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

These are just the toolbar trying to discover Cursor instances. Once Cursor is properly connected, these will stop.

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Activation

Once properly connected to Cursor, you should see:

1. **Interactive Elements**: Clicking on page elements should highlight them
2. **Context Menus**: Right-clicking should show 21st.dev options
3. **Prompt Area**: A text area should appear for leaving comments
4. **AI Suggestions**: The toolbar should offer AI-powered editing suggestions
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes should sync between browser and Cursor

## üìû Cursor-Specific Help

If the toolbar still isn't working after following these steps:

1. **Check the status indicator** in the top-right corner of your browser
2. **Look at browser console** for any error messages
3. **Restart both Cursor and the development server**
4. **Try opening the project in a different Cursor window**
5. **Ensure you're using the latest version of Cursor**

The toolbar is designed to work seamlessly with Cursor once the 21st.dev extension is properly connected!
