> Transform raw ideas into golden prompts through the ancient art of linguistic alchemy

<div class="alchemical-process">
Prompt Alchemy is a sophisticated AI system that transmutes concepts through three sacred phases of refinement. Like the ancient alchemists who sought to transform base metals into gold, we transform raw ideas into potent, precisely-crafted prompts ready for any AI system.
</div>

## Key Features

- ‚öóÔ∏è **Three-Phase Alchemical Transformation**: Prima Materia ‚Üí Solutio ‚Üí Coagulatio
- ü§ñ **Multiple Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, Ollama
- üíæ **Intelligent Grimoire**: SQLite-based storage with vector embeddings
- üìä **Alchemical Ranking**: Automated prompt evaluation and transmutation scoring
- üîÑ **Iterative Refinement**: Meta-prompt optimization through successive iterations
- üé≠ **Persona-Based Transmutation**: Specialized alchemical processes for different domains
- üîç **Semantic Scrying**: Discover similar prompts through embedding-based search
- üìà **Performance Tracking**: Monitor costs, usage patterns, and transmutation success rates

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/jonwraymond/prompt-alchemy.git
cd prompt-alchemy
make build

# Set up configuration
make setup

# Generate your first prompt
./prompt-alchemy generate "Write a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
```

## The Alchemical Process

<div class="alchemical-process">
Transform your ideas through three sacred phases of refinement:

### 1. <span class="phase-badge">Prima Materia</span> (First Matter)
*The raw, unformed potential of your ideas*

Extract the essential essence from your concept. Like gathering the prima materia - the first matter from which all things are made - we capture the raw potential of your request and begin the process of refinement.

### 2. <span class="phase-badge">Solutio</span> (Dissolution)
*The breakdown and purification of ideas*

Dissolve the rigid structures of conventional thinking. Your idea is broken down into its fundamental components and reconstituted in a more fluid, natural form. This phase embodies the flow of human conversation and intuitive understanding.

### 3. <span class="phase-badge">Coagulatio</span> (Crystallization)
*The final form of perfected expression*

Crystallize the refined essence into its most precise and powerful form. Like the philosopher's stone, this final prompt represents the perfect synthesis of clarity, precision, and purpose.
</div>

## The Alchemical Advantage

Traditional prompt engineering is like working with raw metals - unpredictable and inconsistent. Prompt Alchemy brings the ancient wisdom of transformation to modern AI:

1. **Sacred Phases**: Each alchemical phase refines specific qualities - from raw potential to crystallized perfection
2. **Multi-Provider Mastery**: Harness different AI providers' unique strengths for each transformation phase
3. **Empirical Wisdom**: Track successful transmutations with comprehensive analytics and metrics
4. **Self-Improving System**: Let the system learn and optimize its own alchemical processes
