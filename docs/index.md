# Prompt Alchemy

Prompt Alchemy transforms your raw ideas into high-quality prompts for AI systems. 

The tool uses a three-phase refinement process to create precise, effective prompts. You can use it as a command-line tool or integrate it with AI agents.

> **What you'll accomplish**: Generate better prompts, integrate with multiple AI providers, and improve results over time with machine learning.

## Key features

- **Three-phase prompt refinement**: Improves your prompts through idea extraction, natural language flow, and precision tuning
- **Multiple AI providers**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, and local Ollama models
- **Intelligent selection**: Uses AI to automatically choose the best prompt variants
- **Flexible deployment**: Run as a CLI tool for quick tasks or as a server for AI agent integration
- **Adaptive learning**: Improves recommendations over time based on your feedback
- **Local storage**: Keeps all your data in a local SQLite database for privacy and speed

## Quick start

### Generate a prompt (CLI)

```bash
# Generate a prompt with all three refinement phases
prompt-alchemy generate "A blog post about the future of AI" --persona=writing
```

### Start a server (for AI agents)

```bash
# Start the MCP server for AI agent integration
prompt-alchemy serve
```

AI agents can connect to the server using `stdin`/`stdout` and make JSON-RPC calls.

## How it works

Prompt Alchemy refines your ideas through three phases:

1. **Extract core concepts**: Identifies the key ideas from your input
2. **Create natural flow**: Transforms concepts into readable, flowing language  
3. **Add precision**: Refines the prompt for accuracy and effectiveness

Each phase can use a different AI provider for optimal results.

## Why use Prompt Alchemy?

Unlike manual prompt engineering, Prompt Alchemy provides a consistent, measurable approach:

- **Repeatable process**: Every prompt goes through the same proven refinement steps
- **Provider flexibility**: Use the best AI model for each phase of improvement  
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor success rates and identify what works best
- **Continuous improvement**: The system learns from your feedback to get better over time
