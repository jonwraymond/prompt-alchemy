- **Self-Verifying Loops**: Automated build, test, and lint verification
- **Checkpoint-Based Development**: Frequent commits for easy rollbacks

### 2. Collaborative Coding Strategies
- **Detailed Prompting**: Specific, actionable prompt examples
- **Synchronous Development**: Working alongside Claude Code for critical logic
- **Phased Implementation**: AI-first generation followed by human refinement

### 3. Quality Assurance Workflows
- **Automated Test Generation**: Commands for comprehensive test coverage
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: PR comment automation with Claude Code
- **Test-Driven Development**: Workflows for TDD with AI assistance

### 4. Documentation & Knowledge Management
- **Living Documentation**: Auto-generated runbooks and troubleshooting guides
- **CLAUDE.md as Team Contract**: Using the file to document team workflows
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Creating FAQs from support tickets

### 5. Advanced Patterns
- **Parallel Task Management**: Running multiple Claude Code instances
- **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Breaking complex tasks into focused agents
- **Screenshot-Based Debugging**: Visual problem-solving workflows

### 6. Security & Compliance
- **MCP Server Usage**: Secure handling of sensitive operations
- **Security Review Workflows**: Automated vulnerability analysis
- **Access Control**: Custom implementations for different contexts

### 7. Team Collaboration Rituals
- **Daily Standups**: AI-generated summaries of commits and PRs
- **Code Review Enhancement**: Pre-review analysis and issue highlighting
- **Cross-Functional Enablement**: Allowing non-technical staff to execute workflows

### 8. Productivity Multipliers
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Team-specific automation commands
- **Context Preservation**: Using Serena memory for long-running tasks
- **Knowledge Bases**: Domain-specific context management

## Integration with Existing Policies

All Anthropic practices have been integrated while maintaining compliance with our semantic tool requirements:

1. **Semantic Tool Compliance**: All examples use Serena MCP, code2prompt, or ast-grep
2. **Memory Operations**: Leverage Serena's memory APIs for context preservation
3. **Project Activation**: Examples start with proper project activation
4. **No Manual Navigation**: All code exploration uses approved semantic tools

## Practical Workflow Examples

Three comprehensive examples were added showing:
1. Feature implementation with semantic tools
2. Automated code review workflow
3. Parallel development with sub-agents

Each example demonstrates the integration of:
- Anthropic's best practices
- Our semantic tool requirements
- Proper memory management via Serena
- Checkpoint-based development

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with simple, well-defined tasks
2. **Iterate Rapidly**: Treat Claude Code as an iterative partner
3. **Build Intuition**: Learn which tasks work best autonomously
4. **Refine Continuously**: Improve prompts based on outcomes

## Compatibility Notes

All Anthropic practices are compatible with our existing policies. The integration:
- Enhances our workflows without breaking semantic tool compliance
- Adds practical examples while maintaining our golden rules
- Provides team collaboration patterns that work with our enforcement system
- Offers productivity tips that leverage our existing toolchain
