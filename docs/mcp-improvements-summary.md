# MCP Server Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to prompt-alchemy's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation, incorporating best practices from research and adding self-learning capabilities.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Self-Learning and Database Lookups** ✅

The system now leverages historical prompt data during generation:

- **Vector Similarity Search**: Uses embeddings to find similar historical prompts
- **Pattern Extraction**: Identifies successful patterns from high-scoring prompts
- **Best Examples**: Incorporates top-performing prompts as reference examples
- **Learning Insights**: Provides actionable insights based on historical data

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `HistoryEnhancer` in `internal/engine/history_enhancer.go`
- Added `BestExamples` and `LearningInsights` fields to `EnhancedContext`
- Integrated with the generation flow in `generateSinglePrompt`

### 2. **MCP Server Architecture** ✅

Implemented a robust stdio-based MCP server following best practices:

- **Transport**: Uses stdio (recommended for local implementations)
- **Tools**: All 6 tools properly exposed with complete parameter schemas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper JSON-RPC responses
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### 3. **Phase Provider Configuration Fix** ✅

Resolved the "no provider configured for phase" error:

- Added fallback logic to use first available provider if OpenAI isn't available
- Enhanced debugging with detailed logging of provider configuration
- Improved provider registration and availability checking

### 4. **Hybrid Storage System** ✅

Confirmed and documented the hybrid storage architecture:

- **SQLite (WASM)**: For structured data and metadata
- **chromem-go**: For vector embeddings and similarity search
- **Persistent Storage**: Both databases persist data between sessions

### 5. **Configuration and Documentation** ✅

Created comprehensive configuration and documentation:

- **config.quickstart.yaml**: Complete configuration for Docker/MCP deployment
- **self-learning.md**: Detailed documentation of self-learning features
- **Dockerfile.quickstart**: Ready-to-use Docker configuration

## How Self-Learning Works

When generating prompts, the system now:

1. **Creates an embedding** of the input
2. **Searches for similar prompts** with high relevance scores
3. **Extracts patterns** from successful prompts
4. **Enhances the input** with historical insights
5. **Generates better prompts** using this enriched context

Example enhancement:
```
Original: "Create a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

Enhanced: 
- Historical insights about best providers
- Successful patterns (e.g., numbered lists, step-by-step)
- Reference examples from high-scoring prompts
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Quality**: Prompts leverage proven patterns and examples
2. **Consistency**: Maintains consistent style based on historical success
3. **Optimization**: Learns which providers and parameters work best
4. **Reduced Iterations**: Fewer attempts needed to get desired results
5. **Knowledge Retention**: System learns and improves over time

## Environment Variables Exposed

All configuration is accessible via environment variables:

```bash
# Provider API Keys
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_PROVIDERS_OPENAI_API_KEY
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_PROVIDERS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_API_KEY
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_PROVIDERS_GROK_API_KEY

# Embedding Configuration
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS

# Self-Learning Settings
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_SELF_LEARNING_ENABLED
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_SELF_LEARNING_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE
PROMPT_ALCHEMY_SELF_LEARNING_MAX_EXAMPLES
```

## MCP Tools Available

1. **generate_prompts**: Generate prompts with self-learning enhancement
2. **search_prompts**: Search existing prompts using embeddings
3. **get_prompt**: Retrieve specific prompt by ID
4. **list_providers**: List available LLM providers
5. **optimize_prompt**: Optimize prompts using meta-prompting
6. **batch_generate**: Generate multiple prompts concurrently

## Testing and Validation

Successfully tested:
- ✅ MCP server starts and accepts requests
- ✅ Generate prompts tool works with all phases
- ✅ Self-learning enhancement activates when historical data exists
- ✅ Vector search finds similar prompts
- ✅ Pattern extraction identifies successful elements
- ✅ Meta-prompting optimization functions correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:

1. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Adjust learning based on success metrics
2. **Cross-Phase Analysis**: Learn patterns across all phases
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate integration of user feedback
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Share learnings across instances
5. **Streamable HTTP**: Migrate from stdio to streaming for remote access

## Conclusion

The prompt-alchemy MCP server now incorporates advanced self-learning capabilities that significantly improve prompt generation quality by leveraging historical data, vector embeddings, and pattern recognition. The system is production-ready with comprehensive configuration, documentation, and error handling.
