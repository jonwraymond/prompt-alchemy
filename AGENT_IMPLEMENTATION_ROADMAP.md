- Cons: Operational complexity, network overhead
- Decision: Deferred to future enhancement

### 3. Embedded Scripting (Lua/JS)
- Pros: Dynamic agent creation, no recompilation
- Cons: Performance overhead, debugging difficulty
- Decision: Considered for Phase 7+

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to implementing the sub-agent orchestration system. By following this phased approach, we can:

1. **Address user pain points incrementally** - Each phase delivers value
2. **Manage technical risk** - Complex components built on solid foundations
3. **Maintain system stability** - Gradual integration with existing features
4. **Enable continuous validation** - Testing at every phase

The implementation prioritizes reliability and context management (addressing pain points 1 & 2) in early phases, with automation and ease of use (pain point 3) improving throughout the process.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up development branch for agent system
   - Create project tracking board
   - Assign team members to Phase 1 components

2. **Week 1 Goals**
   - Complete agent registry implementation
   - Have basic agent loading working
   - Establish testing patterns

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Weekly progress updates
   - Bi-weekly demos to stakeholders
   - Public beta after Phase 5

This roadmap is a living document and should be updated as implementation progresses and new insights emerge.
