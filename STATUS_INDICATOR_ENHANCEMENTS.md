## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Changes
1. **Dot styling**: Increased size, added padding for hit area
2. **Animation**: Pulsating effect for operational status
3. **Touch optimizations**: Larger dots and spacing on touch devices
4. **Hover/Active states**: Visual feedback for interaction

### TypeScript Changes
1. **Touch detection**: `isTouchDevice` state variable
2. **Click handler**: Toggle tooltip on tap for mobile

- Pulsating animation only applies to operational (green) dots
- All dots maintain 44x44px minimum touch target

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with touch event support
- CSS animations with fallback for reduced motion
- Pointer media query for touch device detection
- Full keyboard navigation support
