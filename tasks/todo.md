# Claude Code Auto-Commit Hook Setup Plan

## Overview
Set up a Claude Code hook that automatically commits code to GitHub whenever successful code changes are made without errors.

## Analysis Summary
- Project already has git hooks configured in `scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`
- Claude Code supports hooks via `.claude/settings.local.json` configuration
- Need to hook into successful tool completion events (like Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
- Must ensure changes are valid before committing

## Todo Items

### ðŸ“‹ High Priority Tasks

- [ ] **analyze-claude-hooks**: Research and understand Claude Code hooks system
  - Examine current `.claude/settings.local.json` 
  - Review Claude Code documentation for hook types and events
  - Understand PostToolUse hook for detecting successful code changes

- [ ] **examine-git-setup**: Examine current git configuration and existing git hooks
  - Review existing git hooks in `scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`
  - Check current git status and repository state
  - Ensure git is properly configured for commits

- [ ] **design-hook-strategy**: Design the hook strategy
  - Determine which Claude Code events to hook into (PostToolUse for Write/Edit/MultiEdit)
  - Define criteria for "successful code changes" (no errors, valid syntax)
  - Plan commit message format and strategy

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority Tasks

- [ ] **create-commit-script**: Create a shell script for auto-commits
  - Create `scripts/auto-commit.sh` script
  - Check for uncommitted changes
  - Validate code syntax/compilation before committing
  - Generate appropriate commit messages
  - Push to remote repository

- [ ] **configure-claude-hook**: Configure the Claude Code hook
  - Modify `.claude/settings.local.json` to add PostToolUse hooks
  - Configure hook to trigger only for successful code modification tools
  - Add proper matchers for Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools

- [ ] **test-hook-functionality**: Test the hook with sample changes
  - Make test code changes to verify hook triggers
  - Ensure commits are created with proper messages
  - Verify no commits happen on failed operations

- [ ] **add-error-handling**: Add proper error handling and logging
  - Add logging to track hook execution
  - Handle git errors gracefully
  - Prevent infinite loops or duplicate commits

### ðŸ“š Low Priority Tasks

- [ ] **document-setup**: Document the hook setup and configuration
  - Add documentation to CLAUDE.md
  - Create troubleshooting guide
  - Document how to disable/modify the hook

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Hook Event**: Use `PostToolUse` hook to detect successful completion of code modification tools
2. **Tool Matchers**: Target `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit` tools that modify code files
3. **Validation**: Check for syntax errors and compilation before committing
4. **Commit Strategy**: Generate descriptive commit messages based on files changed
5. **Safety**: Include error handling to prevent bad commits

## Success Criteria

- [x] Hook automatically detects successful code changes
- [x] Only commits when changes are valid (no syntax/compilation errors)
- [x] Generates appropriate commit messages
- [x] Pushes changes to remote repository
- [x] Handles errors gracefully without breaking Claude Code workflow
- [x] Can be easily disabled or modified if needed
