# Progress Streaming Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Progress streaming has been successfully implemented for long-running operations in the MCP server. This feature provides real-time feedback to users about the status of their prompt generation requests.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Progress Tracker Module (`cmd/serve_progress.go`)
- Created a dedicated `ProgressTracker` struct to manage progress notifications
- Implements MCP progress notification protocol with:
  - `Start()`: Begins progress tracking with a title
  - `Update()`: Sends progress updates with percentage
  - `End()`: Completes progress tracking
- Thread-safe implementation using mutex for concurrent operations

### 2. Integration Points

#### Generate Prompts Handler
- Added `progressToken` parameter extraction
- Wrapped phase generation in progress tracking:
  - **Best strategy**: Shows progress for each phase
  - **Cascade strategy**: Shows refinement progress through phases  
  - **All strategy**: Shows overall generation progress
- Progress updates include:
  - Current phase being processed
  - Percentage completion
  - Final summary of generated prompts

#### Batch Generation Handler
- Added `progressToken` parameter extraction
- Progress tracking for concurrent batch processing:
  - Initial notification shows total prompts to process
  - Updates after each prompt completion
  - Thread-safe counter tracks completed items
  - Final notification shows success/error summary

### 3. MCP Protocol Compliance
- Progress notifications follow MCP spec:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "$/progress",
    "params": {
      "progressToken": <token>,
      "progress": {
        "kind": "begin|report|end",
        "title": "...",
        "message": "...",
        "percentage": 0-100
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Progress tokens are properly extracted from requests
- ✅ Progress notifications are sent via the encoder
- ✅ Thread-safe operation in batch processing
- ✅ Graceful handling when no progress token provided

## Usage Example
When calling MCP tools with progress support, include a progressToken:
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "generate_prompts",
    "arguments": {
      "input": "Create a REST API",
      "progressToken": "unique-token-123"
    }
  }
}
```

The server will send progress notifications:
1. Begin: "Generating prompts"
2. Report: "Processing solutio phase" (33%)
3. Report: "Processing coagulatio phase" (66%)
4. End: "Generated 3 prompts"

## Benefits
- Better user experience with real-time feedback
- Transparency into long-running operations
- Ability to track batch processing progress
- Foundation for future cancellation support
