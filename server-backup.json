I'm particularly interested in understanding how we can optimize and improve our NLP microservices architecture. Let me walk you through what I'm hoping to explore together.\n\nI'd love for us to dive deep into four main areas that I'm really curious about:\n\n1. First, let's explore the heart of our system - the MCP Server. I want to understand:\n   - How do our core components talk to each other? \n   - What's the journey of a request through our system?\n   - How are we handling concurrent requests? (I've noticed some interesting patterns in our code)\n   \n   For example, I'm seeing patterns like this in our request handling:\n   ```go\n   func (s *Server) handleRequest(ctx context.Context, req *Request) {\n       // What's happening here?\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. I'm fascinated by our semantic embedding system, and I'd love your thoughts on:\n   - How we're generating and comparing these vectors\n   - Our storage solutions (are we using the best approach?)\n   - Whether our current embedding dimensions make sense\n\n3. Performance is crucial for us, so could you examine our lightweight processing?\n   - Are we being smart with our resources?\n   - How's our memory management looking?\n   - Are we using goroutines effectively?\n\n4. Finally, I'm really interested in our meta-prompting system:\n   - How are we generating and optimizing prompts?\n   - Is our feedback loop working effectively?\n   - Could our versioning be more robust?\n\nFor each area, could you help me understand:\n- The big picture (maybe with some architecture diagrams?)\n- The nitty-gritty technical details (especially any clever algorithms we're using)\n- Where we could improve\n- Real code examples that illustrate key points\n\nI'm particularly concerned about making sure our code is:\n- Production-ready and reliable\n- Scalable for our growing user base\n- Secure and well-error-handled\n- Threading-safe (we've had some interesting concurrency challenges!)\n\nWhile you're looking through this, please keep in mind:\n- We love idiomatic Go solutions\n- We try to leverage the standard library where possible\n- We need to support multiple platforms\n- We're always thinking about dependency management\n\nCould you walk me through your analysis? Feel free to challenge any assumptions you see in our current implementation - I'm really looking for honest, practical insights that will help us make better technical decisions.\n\nI'd especially appreciate any war stories or experiences you might have with similar systems. What pitfalls should we watch out for? What patterns have you seen work really well in practice?\n```\n\nThis version:\n- Creates a personal connection through first-person narrative\n- Adds conversational elements and questions\n- Includes specific code examples\n- Maintains technical precision while being more approachable\n- Invites dialogue and experience sharing\n- Shows genuine curiosity and openness to feedback\n- Makes the technical requirements feel more natural and contextual\n- Uses more engaging language while preserving the technical depth\n\nThe tone is more collaborative and inviting while still maintaining the professional technical focus of the original prompt.",

If the `target` is not found, return `-1`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the function handles the following scenarios:\n     - An empty list should return `-1`.\n     - The target value is less than the smallest element in the list, which should also return `-1`.\n     - The target value is greater than the largest element in the list, returning `-1`.\n     - The target value is the first or last element in the list, confirming that the function can locate values at the boundaries.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nThe function should be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list: List[int], target: int) -\u003e int:\n    # Implementation goes here\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nHere is an example of how the function should be used:\n\n```python\n# Example inputs\nsorted_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nresult = binary_search(sorted_numbers, 5)\nprint(result)  # Expected output: 4 (index of the target)\n\nresult_not_found = binary_search(sorted_numbers, 10)\nprint(result_not_found)  # Expected output: -1\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- Ensure code readability and follow Python's PEP 8 style guide.\n- Include comments within the code to explain key steps of the algorithm.\n- Test the function with various test cases to validate its correctness, including edge cases described above. \n\nBy following these guidelines, you will create a clear and effective binary search function that meets the requirements outlined.",

This function should be able to efficiently search for a target value in a sorted list and return the index of the target value if found, or -1 if the target value is not present in the list.\n\n---\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: \n   - Name the function `binary_search`.\n   - The function should take two parameters:\n     - `sorted_list`: A list of elements (integers or floats) that is sorted in ascending order.\n     - `target`: The value to be searched within the `sorted_list`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Requirements**:\n   - Implement the binary search algorithm. You may use either an iterative or recursive approach, but ensure that the method chosen is well-documented.\n   - The algorithm should repeatedly divide the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.\n\n3. **Return Values**:\n   - If the target value is found, return the index (an integer) of the target in the `sorted_list`.\n   - If the target value is not found, return -1.\n\n4. **Edge Cases to Consider**:\n   - If the input list is empty, the function should immediately return -1.\n   - Handle cases where the target is less than the smallest element or greater than the largest element in the list.\n   - Ensure that the function can handle lists with duplicate values, returning the index of any occurrence of the target value.\n   - Include validation to ensure that the input list is indeed sorted; if not, return -1.\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Include a docstring within the function that describes:\n     - The purpose of the function.\n     - The parameters and their expected types.\n     - The return type and what it signifies.\n\n---\n\n**Expected Output Format**:\n- The function should return either an integer index or -1.\n- Include a sample test case demonstrating the function in action, showing both a successful search and an unsuccessful search.\n\n---\n\n**Example Usage**:\n```python\nresult = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)\nprint(result)  # Expected output: 2\n\nresult = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)\nprint(result)  # Expected output: -1\n```\n\nIn your implementation, ensure that the function adheres to the specifications above and can handle various edge cases effectively. \n\n--- \n\n**End of Prompt**.",

Optimizing these components not only enhances user experience by reducing load times but also strengthens the overall security posture of the application.\n\n### Key Areas of Optimization\n\n#### Code Splitting\nCode splitting allows you to load only the necessary parts of your application, reducing the initial load time. You can implement this in your authentication component using React.lazy and Suspense:\n\n```javascript\nconst LoginComponent = React.lazy(() =\u003e import('./LoginComponent'));\n\n// Inside your render method\n\u003cSuspense fallback={\u003cdiv\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e}\u003e\n  \u003cLoginComponent /\u003e\n\u003c/Suspense\u003e\n```\n\n#### Memoization\nUsing memoization can help prevent unnecessary re-renders. You can utilize `React.memo` for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ prop }) =\u003e {\n  // Component logic\n});\n```\n\n#### Reducing Re-renders\nTo minimize re-renders, consider using the `useCallback` hook to memoize functions passed to child components:\n\n```javascript\nconst handleSubmit = useCallback(() =\u003e {\n  // Submit logic\n}, [dependencies]);\n```\n\n#### Optimizing API Calls\nWhen making API calls, it’s essential to manage performance effectively. Consider using debouncing for input fields to limit the frequency of API requests:\n\n```javascript\nconst debouncedFetch = useDebounce(fetchData, 300);\n```\n\n### Performance Testing and Tools\nTo ensure your authentication component performs well, utilize tools such as React Profiler, which can help identify performance bottlenecks. Use Chrome DevTools to monitor network requests and assess loading times.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\nWhen optimizing, consider edge cases such as users on slow connections. Implement loading indicators and fallback messages to enhance user experience during these times.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptimizing your React authentication component is vital for improving performance and user experience. Regular monitoring and adjustments will ensure that your application remains responsive and secure.\n\n--- \n\nThis prompt is structured to elicit comprehensive, professional content that is both informative and practical, catering to a general audience while addressing performance optimization for React authentication components.",

The component should allow users to log in and log out, handle form validation, and provide feedback on authentication status.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Component Structure:**\n   - Create a functional component named `UserAuthentication`.\n   - Use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage component state.\n   - Include two primary states: `isLoggedIn` (boolean) and `formData` (object holding username and password).\n   - Implement a method to handle form submission.\n\n2. **Form Fields:**\n   - Include two input fields: one for the username and one for the password.\n   - Ensure both fields are required and implement basic validation (e.g., non-empty).\n   - Display error messages for invalid inputs.\n\n3. **Authentication Logic:**\n   - Simulate an authentication process. Create a function `authenticateUser` that takes the `username` and `password` as arguments and returns a promise that resolves if the credentials are valid (for example, username: \"user\" and password: \"password\") or rejects with an error message if invalid.\n   - On successful authentication, update `isLoggedIn` to `true` and store the user session (you can use local storage for this purpose).\n   - On logout, reset the `isLoggedIn` state and clear the session.\n\n4. **Feedback Mechanism:**\n   - Use conditional rendering to show feedback messages:\n     - \"Login successful!\" when the user logs in.\n     - \"Invalid username or password.\" when authentication fails.\n     - A logout button that is displayed when the user is logged in.\n\n5. **Styling:**\n   - Use simple CSS for styling. Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Handle cases where the user inputs incorrect credentials multiple times (e.g., provide a limit after which the user cannot attempt to log in).\n   - Consider network errors during authentication and provide a user-friendly error message.\n\n**Expected Output Format:**\n\n- The final output should be a complete React component code snippet, structured as follows:\n  - Import statements for React and any necessary libraries.\n  - The `UserAuthentication` functional component definition.\n  - JSX template for rendering the form and feedback messages.\n  - Logic for handling state changes and form submission.\n  - Any necessary CSS styles encapsulated within a `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag or as a separate CSS module.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst UserAuthentication = () =\u003e {\n    const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);\n    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ username: '', password: '' });\n    const [error, setError] = useState('');\n\n    const authenticateUser = (username, password) =\u003e {\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n            // Simulate authentication\n            if (username === 'user' \u0026\u0026 password === 'password') {\n                resolve();\n            } else {\n                reject('Invalid username or password.');\n            }\n        });\n    };\n\n    const handleChange = (e) =\u003e {\n        setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });\n    };\n\n    const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        authenticateUser(formData.username, formData.password)\n            .then(() =\u003e {\n                setIsLoggedIn(true);\n                localStorage.setItem('user', formData.username);\n                setError('');\n            })\n            .catch(err =\u003e setError(err));\n    };\n\n    const handleLogout = () =\u003e {\n        setIsLoggedIn(false);\n        localStorage.removeItem('user');\n    };\n\n    return (\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n            {isLoggedIn ?

Default to Python/Node.js if no specific language is requested, but indicate where language-specific libraries are used.\n\n5.  **Handling Edge Cases \u0026 Advanced Scenarios:**\n    *   Account recovery without 2FA device access\n    *   Suspicious login attempt detection and response (e.g., geo-location, unusual activity)\n    *   Session expiration strategies (idle vs. absolute timeouts, forced logout)\n    *   Account deletion and data retention considerations\n\n6.  **Security Best Practices:**\n    *   HTTPS/TLS enforcement\n    *   Rate limiting and throttling strategies\n    *   Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing\n    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQLi relevant to authentication)\n    *   Least privilege principle for user roles\n\n7.  **Performance Considerations:**\n    *   Database query optimization for authentication operations (e.g., indexing, efficient lookups)\n    *   Scalability considerations for high user loads (e.g., stateless tokens, distributed sessions)\n    *   Response time optimization for login/registration processes\n    *   Caching strategies for session data or frequently accessed user information\n\n8.  **Maintenance \u0026 Future-Proofing:**\n    *   Dependency management and timely updates\n    *   Adapting to evolving security threats and standards\n    *   User education on security practices\n\n9.  **Recommended Resources:**\n    *   Suggest reputable external resources for further learning (e.g., OWASP, NIST guidelines).\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n*   **Clarity \u0026 Precision:** Use clear, unambiguous, and technically accurate language.\n*   **Structure:** Organize content logically with distinct headings, subheadings, and bullet points.\n*   **Tone:** Professional, authoritative, and practical.\n*   **Conciseness:** Be direct and avoid conversational filler, anecdotes, or redundant phrasing.\n*   **Actionable:** Provide concrete advice, best practices, and actionable steps.\n*   **Token Efficiency:** Prioritize concise language without sacrificing detail or clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Changes and Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Explicit Persona \u0026 Goal:** Starts directly by defining the AI's role and the primary objective. This sets clear expectations immediately.\n2.  **Structured Requirements:** Uses numbered sections and bullet points for all required content areas. This enhances clarity, ensures all aspects are covered, and makes the prompt easier for the LLM to parse and follow.\n3.  **Removed Redundancy \u0026 Fluff:** Eliminated all conversational greetings, anecdotes, motivational statements, and repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"I'll show you...\", \"Remember: We're not just building...\"). The AI doesn't need to be persuaded; it needs instructions.\n4.  **Enhanced Precision:**\n    *   Replaced vague phrases like \"Setting up those first crucial security measures\" with specific examples (\"default permissions, account activation\").\n    *   Specified types of MFA (TOTP, WebAuthn) and KDFs (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt).\n    *   Clarified session management methods (JWTs, opaque tokens, cookies).\n    *   Added specific web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQLi) relevant to auth.\n5.  **Added Performance-Oriented Instructions:** A new dedicated section addresses this requirement, detailing specific areas like database query optimization, scalability, response times, and caching.\n6.  **Refined \"Real-World Implementation\":** Clarifies that snippets are for \"key concepts\" and sets a default language if not specified.\n7.  **Consolidated \"Tricky Stuff\":** Renamed to \"Handling Edge Cases \u0026 Advanced Scenarios\" and added \"Account deletion and data retention considerations.\"\n8.  **Refined \"Security Best Practices\":** Added \"Least privilege principle for user roles.\"\n9.  **Explicit Output Requirements:** Moved the desired output characteristics (clarity, structure, tone, conciseness, actionable, token efficiency) into a dedicated section at the end. This clearly instructs the LLM on *how* to format its response.\n10. **Token Efficiency:** The overall prompt is significantly shorter and denser due to the removal of conversational elements and the use of concise phrasing, while actually *increasing* the detailed requirements. This means more instruction per token.",

I'm going to help you create your first REST API endpoint from scratch. As someone who's built countless APIs, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can feel at first. But don't worry - I'll walk you through every step, just like I wish someone had done for me when I was starting out.\n\n🎯 What We're Building Together\nLet's create a real-world API endpoint that actually does something useful. I'm thinking we'll build an endpoint for a book management system - something that lets you add and retrieve books from a digital library. It's simple enough to understand but complex enough to teach you the important concepts.\n\n📋 Here's Our Game Plan:\n\n1. First Steps\n- I'll explain what REST APIs are (in plain English, I promise!)\n- We'll talk about why they're crucial for modern apps (with real examples you'll recognize)\n- I'll show you exactly what an endpoint is using our book library example\n\n2. Planning Our Endpoint\n- We'll decide what our endpoint should do (add/get/update/delete books)\n- I'll help you choose the right HTTP methods (GET for fetching books, POST for adding new ones, etc.)\n- We'll design a clean, intuitive URL structure (like /api/v1/books)\n\n3. Building It Out\n- I'll guide you through coding the endpoint in both Node.js/Express AND Python/Flask (you can choose your preferred language)\n- We'll write actual code together, and I'll explain every line\n- I'll share some tricks I've learned to make your code more maintainable\n\n4. Making It Bulletproof\n- We'll handle everything that could go wrong (trust me, things WILL go wrong!)\n- I'll show you how to send back helpful error messages that won't confuse your users\n- We'll add proper status codes (and I'll explain why 200 isn't always the answer)\n\n5. Testing Like a Pro\n- I'll introduce you to Postman (my favorite API testing tool)\n- We'll write tests that make sure our endpoint works perfectly\n- I'll share my personal checklist for testing any API endpoint\n\n6. Documentation That People Will Actually Read\n- I'll show you how to write clear, helpful documentation\n- We'll create example requests and responses that make sense\n- I'll share my template for documenting any API endpoint\n\n🔍 Real-World Considerations:\nThroughout our journey, I'll point out important things I've learned the hard way:\n- Security gotchas to watch out for\n- How to make your endpoint fast and efficient\n- Future-proofing your API so you don't have to rebuild it next month\n\nBy the end of this guide, you'll have built a production-ready API endpoint and understood every part of the process. I'll be using lots of real-world examples and sharing stories from my own experience to help concepts stick.\n\nReady to build something awesome together? Let's dive in! \n\n💡 Pro Tip: Keep this guide handy - you'll probably want to reference it the next time you're building an API endpoint!\n\n---\n\nNotice how this version:\n- Uses a friendly, mentor-like tone\n- Includes specific examples (book management system)\n- Adds emotional resonance through shared experience\n- Uses emojis strategically for visual breaks\n- Maintains all technical information while making it more approachable\n- Includes personal touches that make it feel like a conversation\n- Structures information in an easily digestible way",
